## Algorithm

An algorithm is a set of instructions that a program must follow in order to solve a problem. There are a variety of ways to show an algorithm in Programming as Flowcharts and Pseudo code are the most common ways of showing it since they allow the user to see the instructions that a program will follow when it is running enabling the reader to understand what is going on even if they have no prior knowledge of programming.
## Process of Building an application
This section will be explaining all of the steps that need to be taken when building an application in order to meet the needs of the client.
### Obtaining Requirements
The first step that has to be taken is to meet with the client in order to establish a set of requirements that need to be met so that the application does what they want and need it to do. Additionally, this step can be used to determine the budget and time-frame of how long the project may take to complete, from this the company can then set out to allocate tasks to employees in order to meet deadlines.
### Design
In this phase the employees decide on which architecture will be best suited for this project in order to ensure maximum efficiency. Usually more than one design approach is proposed in order to send this off to the main stakeholders, who then review the various parameters, such as risk assessment, product robustness, budget and time constraints which then leads to them making a decision on what the best design architecture is for the program./
After this is done, the actual designing of the project takes place
### Implementation
### Testing
### Deployment
### Maintainence
